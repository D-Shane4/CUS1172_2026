                <p class="text">For my elementary-middle schools years, I went to a private catholic school in Bronx, NY
                    known as Sts. Philip and James that has
                    now unfortunately shut down and been replaced with a charter school. For higshschool, I went to
                    Cardinal Spellman Highschool
                    from 2019-2023 and graduated with my diploma. During my time there, I received first and second
                    honors as well as an natioanl
                    recognition award from college board representing excelling african american students. I'm currently
                    attending St. John's University
                    in Queens and well on the way to acheivieng my Bachelors of Computer Scinece.

                <p class="text">I consider myself to have decent coding skills. I mainly have expperience with Java, as
                    that is what I've worked with
                    throughout my time at St John's taking CUS courses. I've worked a little with SQL for a database
                    managment course I took
                    in the 2025 fall sememster. Outside of univeristy, I learned a little HTMl/CSS prior to taking this
                    course from an online
                    course on UDEMY.

                <p class="text">Regarding my hobbies, I like to read. My favorite book series is Six of Crows by Leigh
                    Bardugo. I try to read at least 10-15 pages a day but during the sememster
                    it tends to get busy so I don't manage to complete the goal very often. I also like to workout. As a
                    commuter, I don't really like using the on campus gym cause I
                    have to bring an extra bag with a change of clothes and use the showers in the locker rooms, which I
                    feel is a hassale. Gym memberships are also relatively expensive, so I mainly
                    just workout from home and make due with what I have. Another one of my interests/hobbies is
                    badminton. I discovered what it was in higschool during gym period and
                    have been playing it ever since. I'm even on the E-board for the badminton club at St John's.
