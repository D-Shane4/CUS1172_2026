    <p>Hello, my name is Dushane Salmon. I'm a third year computer science major at St. John's University. Fun fact, my favorite color is

    <h1 id = "ED">Education</h1>
    <p>For my elementary-middle schools years, I went to a private catholic school in Bronx, NY known as Sts. Philip and James that has 
        now unfortunately shut down and been replaced with a charter school. For higshschool, I went to Cardinal Spellman Highschool 
        from 2019-2023 and graduated with my diploma. During my time there, I received first and second honors as well as an natioanl 
        recognition award from college board representing excelling african american students. I'm currently attending St. John's University
        in Queens and well on the way to acheivieng my Bachelors of Computer Scinece.

    <h1 id = "PS"> Programming Skills</h1>
    <p>I consider myself to have decent coding skills. I mainly have expperience with Java, as that is what I've worked with
        throughout my time at St John's taking CUS courses. I've worked a little with SQL for a database managment course I took
        in the 2025 fall sememster. Outside of univeristy, I learned a little HTMl/CSS prior to taking this course from an online
        course on UDEMY.

    <h1 id = "GI"> General Interests</h1>
    <p>Regarding my hobbies, I like to read. My favorite book series is Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo. I try to read at least 10-15 pages a day but during the sememster
        it tends to get busy so I don't manage to complete the goal very often. I also like to workout. As a commuter, I don't really like using the on campus gym cause I 
        have to bring an extra bag with a change of clothes and use the showers in the locker rooms, which I feel is a hassale. Gym memberships are also relatively expensive, so I mainly
        just workout from home and make due with what I have. Another one of my interests/hobbies is badminton. I discovered what it was in higschool during gym period and
        have been playing it ever since. I'm even on the E-board for the badminton club at St John's.
